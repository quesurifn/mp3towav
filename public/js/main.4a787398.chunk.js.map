keep your MP3. It's cheaper that way!</p>\n\n        <b>Q: Is converting MP3s to WAVs easy?</b>\n        <p><b>A:</b> Yes! Our site will guide you through it.</p>\n\n        <b>Q: How many files can I upload?</b>\n        <p><b>A:</b> While our uploader allows multiples, our converter will only convert one at a time.</p>\n\n        <b>Q: Am I uploaded on a secure connection?</b>\n        <p><b>A:</b> Yes! Our site is HTTPS (S is for secure).</p>\n\n        <b>Q: Do you provide high quality WAV files?</b>\n        <p><b>A:</b> Yes! When using a lot of other MP3 to WAV converters don't enable the proper settings and gives you a very large file with low quality. Our MP3 to WAV converter gives you a WAV with a similar size to your MP3 all while sounding the exact same as they uploaded MP3!</p>\n\n        <b>Q: Why do you provide your service for free?</b>\n        <p><b>A:</b> With Amazon Web Services these days web hosting is cheap. Our hope is that providing a good experience you will come back and click on our ads which helps us keep the site running.</p>\n\n        <b>Q: What is a WAV used for?</b>\n        <p><b>A:</b> WAV was a file format created by Microsoft and IBM in 1991. Now as we approach 2020 and beyond, WAV is commonly used by music producers for their software and electronic instruments.</p>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n   </section>\n   <section>\n     <h3>Helpful Links</h3>\n     <ul> \n        <li>\n          <a src=\"https://itstillworks.com/12510772/how-to-load-wav-sounds-in-ableton\">Importing WAV files to Ableton</a>\n        </li>\n        <li>\n          <a src=\"https://www.dawsons.co.uk/blog/how-do-mp3-and-wav-files-differ\">The differences between MP3 and WAV files</a>\n        </li>\n        <li>\n          <a src=\"https://support.apple.com/guide/itunes/convert-music-file-formats-itns2972/mac\">iTunes Conversion Guide</a>\n        </li>\n        <li>\n          <a src=\"https://www.macprovideo.com/forums/garageband/garageband/thread/4644-importing-wav-files-to-garageband\">WAV and Garageband</a>\n        </li>\n     </ul>\n   </section>\n </div>)\n  } \n}\n\nexport default Home;\n\n","import React from 'react';\nimport { Link } from 'react-router-dom'\nimport ReactGA from 'react-ga';\nimport { QRCode } from \"react-qr-svg\";\nimport wavIcon from '../../images/wav.png'\nimport AdSense from 'react-adsense';\n\nclass Uploaded extends React.Component {\n  constructor() {\n    super()\n\n    this.handleQRDownload = this.handleQRDownload.bind(this)\n    this.handleDownload = this.handleDownload.bind(this)\n  }\n\n  componentDidMount() {\n    document.getElementsByTagName('footer')[0].style.position = \"fixed\";\n  }\n\n  handleQRDownload() {\n    ReactGA.event({\n      category: 'Download',\n      action: 'QR Click'\n    });\n  }\n\n  handleDownload() {\n    ReactGA.event({\n      category: 'Download',\n      action: 'Button'\n    });\n  }\n\n  render() {\n    const { location, history } = this.props\n    return (\n      <div className=\"container\" id=\"uploaded\">\n        {location.state && location.state.uploadedUrl ?
